* differentiate between interfaces + classes with style?
* maybe add in a 'let/with' expression?
    with EXPR as VAL:
        body
    let VAL = EXPR:
        body



Permutations of each should be distinguishable:

* public, protected, private (# of underscores)
* method, variable
* class, interface (maybe not at this point)
* static/nonstatic (probably no need)

Available symbols:

* ^: interface?
* !: not used
* \|: not used
* @: not used. asynchronous request?
* $: not used
* &: not used
* #: not used
* ?: used as the



Docstrings exist, and work like python. Only included in debug builds.
