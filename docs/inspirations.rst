Insiprations for GreyHawk
=========================

Greyhawk's design was built on the shoulders of giants: Taking the
(arguably) most useful aspects of other languages and assimilating them
under one roof.

Here is a list of inspirations for each of the components of GreyHawk:

* whitespace/tabs to signify scope: Python
* The idea to use characterization such as capitalization to modify
  attributes of elements comes from Go's use of capitalization to
  denote public/private methods
* slices comes from Go
* data-as-code exists in multiple functional languages, but mainly Lisp
* adapters from Clojure's protocols
