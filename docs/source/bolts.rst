Bolts
=====

Bolts are a deeper version of a library, in the sense that it can completely modify the language works internally.

By allowing different bolts, one can have the same syntax and language used for several different patterns we now commonly use:

* Garbage Collection
* Event loop driven architecture (a la Node or Java's NIO)
